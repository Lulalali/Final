    <h1>Welcome to Luis's Page</h1>
    <br>
    <h3> Hello everyone! </h3>
<br>
       <h3> Thank you for joining me today as I present my final project for Programming. Over the past weeks, we've journeyed through the foundational aspects of web development, diving deep into HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Today, I'm excited to showcase how I've synthesized these languages to create a comprehensive project that reflects my understanding and passion for the subject. 
        
        The core objective of my project is to provide an interactive experience that demonstrates the capabilities of each language we've studied: </h3>
        <br>
       <h3> HTML - The backbone of our web project. I've designed several pages to demonstrate my mastery over creating structured content, using forms, linking between pages, and integrating multimedia elements.</h3> 
        <br>
        <h3>JavaScript - To breathe life into these static pages. I've implemented interactive features such as dynamic content generation, user inputs, animations, and even a small game. This not only makes the user experience more engaging but also showcases how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM in real-time. </h3>
        <br>
        <h3>CSS - The beautifier of our content. I've worked on crafting a responsive design that looks clean and aesthetic on both desktop and mobile devices. You'll see the use of flexbox, CSS grid, transitions, and some cool hover effects to make the user interface interactive and pleasing.</h3> 
        <br>
       <h3> As you navigate through the project, you'll witness a blend of creativity and technicality. Each page has its unique interactive elements, and I've ensured to include snippets or comments in the code to explain my thought process. </h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Let's begin </h3>
